# tic-tac-toe-minimax
Developed a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game implementing core programming concepts and game logic. The project features a 3×3 interactive game board, two-player turn-based functionality, input validation, win/draw detection, and smooth user interaction.  Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of conditional statements, loops.
